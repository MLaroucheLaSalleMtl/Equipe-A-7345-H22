HOW TO USE

Step 01 : CREATE PREFAB VARIANT ========================
+ [MB2 on prefab > Create > Prefab Variant]
+ Change Name

Step 02: ANIMATOR ===================================== (MAY NEED TO IMPLEMENT [Animation Override Controller] INSTEAD)
+ [Animation > Enemy > Basic Enemy AI]
+ CTRL + D... [_TEMPLATE _ ANIMATOR & ANIMATION]
+ Rename Folder
+ Rename Animator (suggested)
+ Rename Animations (suggested)
+ On newly dragged & dropped prefab
	++ Change Animator for copied one
	++ Change [-> ALL <-] animations for copied ones
		++ Do not forget animations of blend tree

+ IMPORTANT NOTE
	++ Some animations use animation events to dictate behaviour...
	   ... in case you need to modify those events, here is the list:
	   
	   +++ OnDeath					  : Last frame  : Destroy object
	   +++ OnAttackRoaming/Aggressive : Last frame  : Reset movement speed at max
	   +++ OnAwake					  : First frame : Set movement speed as 0.0f
	   +++ OnAwake					  : Last frame  : Reset movement speed at max

Step 03: SETTING UP BEHAVIOURS ========================
+ Plug N' Play system

	++ [Basic Enemy Context.cs] - Defining terms
		+++ My Starting State : Which state enemy starts in

		+++ Start at max speed : For, example, ambush type ai (i.e. mimic)

		+++  Weapon Holder for each state
			++++ For Range
			++++ For attack cooldown

		+++ R/A_On Attack Exit boolean
			++++ Shorthand for AI who need to switch state after an attack

		+++ R/A_Anim Execute Attack boolean
			++++ Shorthand for state who uses animation to dictate behaviour execution


	++ Children of main object
		+++ Behaviours _ State _ Roaming
			++++ First behaviour at TOP of list will be used as starting behaviour
				+++++ Applies for both movement and Attack behaviours

		+++ Behaviours _ State _ Aggressive
			++++ First behaviour at TOP of list will be used as starting behaviour
				+++++ Applies for both movement and Attack behaviours			

		+++ Behaviours _ Death / On Hit
			++++ Storage unit for [LivingEntity.cs]'s Events on death & on hit
			

		+++ Behaviours _ Passive
			++++ Passive behaviours which are not dictated by any state management
